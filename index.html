            Tell us about you 
            Welcome to my website! I've been familiarising myself with HTML, JavaScript and CSS to prepare each project. It took a while to get this far, but I am ready to learn more and practice.
            My coding abilities stem from my understanding of Python; a language of which I have much more to learn. When I was younger I had been introduced to an Arduino Uno board and ran a few exercises with it and a breadboard and some other components for fun.
            I've learnt that YouTube tutorials are just as effective to teach a programming language as any book, and allow specific lookups to be possible.
             In order to improve at Python, I have done many exercises - similar to codewars - that solidfy known techniques and highlight new ones. 
             <br></br>
             I am excited to start my studies this year at the University of Surrey in Civil Engineering. I'd like to be a professional coder alongside work in another industry.

<h2>            Talk about why youâ€™d like to move into a career as a web developer
    A few years, I started a crypto-based business which would be based on a website for it's functional platform.
     After a software engineering team had built it, I wanted to learn how to code websites so I could make my own adaptations. I studied React and Rust, yet by the time I got FTP access, I still was far from understanding what each file did.
    I had also realised learning React would not be enough to be able to build on non-React code. I worked through a Python Crash Course book up to Django. Then I realised I would still have to be fluent in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'd like to have the opportunity to join the Founders and Coders team and gain webdesign abbilities.
    I intend to continue developing my general software engineering skillset.
